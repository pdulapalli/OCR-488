Note: the fits structure contains a column for each 'line' of text.

The column is structured thusly:

[vector of fits, 1 for each character in the line]
[vector of chars, the best-fit character for each character in the line]
[vector of images, each character in the line]
[vector of images, each character in the line scaled up to its corresponding best-fit dictionary entry size]
[vector of images, each character in the line's best fit dictionary entry]
